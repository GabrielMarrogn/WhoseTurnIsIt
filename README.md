Hopscotch is probably the game where townhouse's children more have fun, however the game has caused a good time for discussion and crying in children who practice it. The cause of the disorder is to decide who will be the next to jump, but recently Quico (The Genius!) had a great idea for to solve the problem. Basically the game can only to be played every two players in one turn and to choose the next player Quico indicated to use the traditional method even or odd, where both players report one number and if the sum these numbers is even, the player that choose PAR win or vice verse. However the use that method has left the Quico crazy, crazy, crazy... And for that reason he asked for your help, asked you a program that given the name of the players, their respective choices (PAR or IMPAR) and the numbers, tell who was the winner.
